# ✅ API Fixed - Filter Routes by Latest Bill Month

## ❌ The Problem

When the mobile app downloaded routes, it was getting **OLD assignments mixed with NEW assignments** because the API wasn't filtering by `bill_month`.

### **Example Issue:**

```
October 2025:
- Admin assigns Zone 011 (100 routes) to Reader A
- Reader A downloads and completes 50 routes

November 2025:
- Admin assigns Zone 011 (100 routes) to Reader A AGAIN
- Reader A taps "Refresh"
- ❌ Gets 200 routes (100 old + 100 new) - WRONG!
- ✅ Should get 100 routes (only November)
```

---

## ✅ The Solution

Updated `/api/routes.php` to **filter by the latest bill_month** for each reader.

### **File:** `public/api/routes.php`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Get latest bill_month first** (Lines 44-51)
2. **Filter routes by that bill_month** (Lines 78-80)
3. **Only check completed readings for current month** (Lines 89-92)

---

## 💻 Code Changes

### **1. Get Latest Bill Month (NEW)**

```php
// Get the latest bill_month for this reader (to avoid mixing old and new assignments)
$latestBillMonth = null;
if ($readerId) {
    $latestBillMonth = MeterReadingSchedule::where('assigned_reader_id', $readerId)
        ->whereIn('status', ['Prepared', 'Assigned', 'In Progress', 'Completed'])
        ->orderBy('bill_month', 'DESC')
        ->value('bill_month');
}
```

**What this does:**
- Finds the most recent `bill_month` for the reader
- Example: `2025-11-01` (November 2025)

---

### **2. Filter Routes by Latest Bill Month (UPDATED)**

```php
// Filter by assigned reader
if ($readerId) {
    $query->where('assigned_reader_id', $readerId);
    
    // Filter by latest bill_month only (don't mix old and new assignments) ⭐
    if ($latestBillMonth) {
        $query->where('bill_month', $latestBillMonth);
    }
}
```

**What this does:**
- Only returns routes for the current billing period
- Excludes old assignments from previous months

---

### **3. Filter Downloaded Readings (UPDATED)**

```php
// Get completed readings from downloaded_readings table
// Only get readings for schedules in the current bill_month ⭐
$downloadedReadings = [];
if ($readerId && !empty($routes)) {
    $scheduleIds = array_column($routes, 'id');
    $downloaded = DownloadedReading::where('reader_id', $readerId)
        ->where('status', 'completed')
        ->whereIn('schedule_id', $scheduleIds)  // ⭐ Only current schedules
        ->get()
        ->keyBy('schedule_id')
        ->toArray();
    $downloadedReadings = $downloaded;
}
```

**What this does:**
- Only checks completed readings for current bill_month schedules
- Avoids mixing completion status from old months

---

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **SQL Queries Run:**

```sql
-- Query 1: Get latest bill_month for reader
SELECT bill_month 
FROM meter_reading_schedules
WHERE assigned_reader_id = 2
  AND status IN ('Prepared', 'Assigned', 'In Progress', 'Completed')
ORDER BY bill_month DESC
LIMIT 1;
-- Result: 2025-11-01

-- Query 2: Get routes for latest bill_month only
SELECT * FROM meter_reading_schedules
WHERE assigned_reader_id = 2
  AND bill_month = '2025-11-01'  -- ⭐ Filters by current month!
  AND status IN ('Prepared', 'Assigned', 'In Progress', 'Completed')
ORDER BY sedr_number;

-- Query 3: Get completed readings for those schedules
SELECT * FROM downloaded_readings
WHERE reader_id = 2
  AND status = 'completed'
  AND schedule_id IN (1, 2, 3, ...)  -- ⭐ Only current schedules!
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### **Before (Broken):**

```
October Assignments (old):
- 100 routes for Zone 011, bill_month = 2025-10-01
- 50 completed, 50 pending

November Assignments (new):
- 100 routes for Zone 011, bill_month = 2025-11-01
- All pending

API Returns: ❌ 200 routes (100 old + 100 new)
Mobile App Shows: 150 pending + 50 completed (MIXED!)
```

### **After (Fixed):**

```
October Assignments (old):
- 100 routes for Zone 011, bill_month = 2025-10-01
- Ignored by API ✅

November Assignments (new):
- 100 routes for Zone 011, bill_month = 2025-11-01
- All pending

API Returns: ✅ 100 routes (only November)
Mobile App Shows: 100 pending (CORRECT!)
```

## 🎯 Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Monthly Cycle**

```
Month 1 (October):
- Admin assigns 100 routes
- Reader completes all 100
- bill_month = 2025-10-01

Month 2 (November):
- Admin assigns 100 NEW routes
- bill_month = 2025-11-01
- Reader taps "Refresh"
- ✅ Gets 100 routes (only November, not October)
```

### **Scenario 2: Mid-Month Assignment**

```
November 1:
- Admin assigns Zone 011 (50 routes)
- bill_month = 2025-11-01

November 15:
- Admin assigns Zone 021 (50 routes) MORE
- bill_month = 2025-11-01 (same month)
- Reader taps "Refresh"
- ✅ Gets 100 routes (both zones, same month)
```

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Months**

```
Reader has assignments in:
- October: bill_month = 2025-10-01
- November: bill_month = 2025-11-01
- December: bill_month = 2025-12-01

API Returns:
- ✅ Only December routes (latest bill_month)
```

## 🔍 Verification

### **Test Query:**

```sql
-- Check what the API will return
SELECT 
    bill_month,
    COUNT(*) as total_routes,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed
FROM meter_reading_schedules
WHERE assigned_reader_id = 2
GROUP BY bill_month
ORDER BY bill_month DESC;

-- Result should show:
-- 2025-11-01 | 100 | 20    ← API returns this
-- 2025-10-01 | 100 | 100   ← API ignores this
```

### **Test in Browser:**

```
http://localhost/WD/public/api/routes.php?reader_id=2
```

**Check response:**
- `bill_month` field shows current month
- `total_routes` shows count for that month only
- `data` array contains only current month routes

## 📝 Database Impact

### **No Schema Changes**
- No new tables
- No new columns
- Only query logic changed

### **Query Performance**
- ✅ Faster (fewer records)
- ✅ Indexed (bill_month + assigned_reader_id)
- ✅ Efficient (single query for latest month)

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Bill Month Format**
- Stored as: `2025-11-01` (first day of month)
