## 📊 Example Data Display

### **Pending Route (Not Completed):**
```
Account: 081-12-2982
Name: SMITH, JANE
Prev. Reading: 1209
Current Reading: -              (not collected yet)
Consumption: -                  (not calculated yet)
Status: 🟠 Assigned
```

### **Completed Route:**
```
Account: 081-12-2982
Name: SMITH, JANE
Prev. Reading: 1209
Current Reading: 1234          (bold blue text) 💙
Consumption: 25                (bold green text) 💚
Status: 🟢 Completed
```

---

## 🎨 Visual Styling

### **Current Reading:**
- **Font:** Bold
- **Color:** Primary Blue (`text-primary`)
- **When:** Reading has been collected
- **Purpose:** Highlight collected readings

### **Consumption:**
- **Font:** Bold
- **Color:** Success Green (`text-success`)
- **When:** Consumption calculated
- **Purpose:** Show water usage clearly

## 📱 Responsive Design

The table is wrapped in `table-responsive` class, so it will:
- ✅ Scroll horizontally on small screens
- ✅ Display all columns properly
- ✅ Maintain readability on mobile/tablet

## 🔍 Data Sources

The data comes from the API endpoint:
```
GET /meter-reading/assignments?reader_id={id}
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "account_number": "081-12-2982",
      "account_name": "SMITH, JANE",
      "previous_reading": 1209,
      "current_reading": 1234,    // ← Used for Current Reading column
      "consumption": 25,           // ← Used for Consumption column
      "status": "Completed"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### **Use Case 1: Daily Progress Check**
```
Admin opens Download Reading page
→ Clicks "View Routes" for Reader A
→ Sees 45 routes completed (bold blue readings)
→ Sees 5 routes pending (dashes)
→ Knows exactly what's left to do
```

### **Use Case 2: Quality Check**
```
Admin reviews completed readings
→ Sees consumption of 1000 m³ (unusually high)
→ Checks current reading: 5234
→ Checks previous reading: 4234
→ Verifies calculation is correct
→ Investigates high usage with customer
```

### **Use Case 3: Performance Review**
```
Manager reviews multiple readers
→ Reader A: 100 routes, 95 completed ✅
→ Reader B: 80 routes, 30 completed ⚠️
→ Makes staffing decisions based on data
```
